 -- Example 4.2: >= with MAX()
 


-- Example 4.3: >= with MIN()

-- Example 5.1: <= with AVG()



-- Example 5.2: <= with MAX()



-- Example 5.3: <= with MIN()



-- Example 5.4: <= with COUNT()



-- 6. Using <> or != (Not Equal To) with Aggregate Functions



-- Example 6.1: <> with AVG()



--Example 6.2: <> with MAX()



-- Example 6.3: <> with MIN()




-- Example 6.4: != with COUNT()




-- 7. Complex Example: Combining Multiple Aggregate Comparisons




--Example 7.1:  "Find films that are above average in price BUT below average in length - premium short films"



--Example 7.2: "Find the most expensive film in the shortest category"
